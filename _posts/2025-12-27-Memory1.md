## FUN THING
Today I watch the symphony by the Vienna Royal Symphony Orchestra.I booked it long time ago with high expection.(Cause it was "ROYAL" hh).

And thing goes as well,arriving at the Guangzhou Beilei Theatre in time,with the fulled venue.The symphony was good, the performers were good and
the Atmosphere was good.A singer sang "You raise me up",the conductor twist his butt to ask for appluse and we applaud with the excited rhythm.

Yeah all the thing is nice.The only problem is that when I back school at the subway I google this "ROYAL" Orchestra.You know what,you can't even find it
in wiki and sth formal introduction.The only thing i saw is a comment calling it Water Orchestra which mean the Orchestra is facker.

However, it is a royal experiment for me.
