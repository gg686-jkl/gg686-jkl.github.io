## 2 minutes rule
* Try to do sth 2 mins first.After that,whatever you want.
* If a thing take you less than 2 mins, so to finish it.
* Don't try sth addicted more than 2 mins or you just want to relax.

That is the most meaningful thing I learnd today.

And it may make sense, so you can have a try if you feel meaningfuless.
